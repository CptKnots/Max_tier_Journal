V1 
Create a program that generates fruit for you to eat based on your favorite color as an input.

V2 
Create a program that generates fruit for you to eat based on your favorite color as an input.  The program will generate either an orange, apple, pear, or grapes depending on which color you select. The colors are blue, red, and yellow. Write logic that uses a random number between one and one hundred plus a color to choose the fruit. For example: Even numbers and blue will provide a response of grapes. Each fruit should have at least 20 numbers that will cause it to be selected as the fruit for you to eat. 

V3 Rerun using old program
Replace the choice of favorite color with 

V4 Rerun with fresh prompt
Create a program that generates a "boost" for you to try based on your mood as an input. The program with generate a boost selected from a family of options that include snacks, drinks, sleep, entertainment. Write logic that uses a number called "HP" plus the mood selection to choose the boost. For example the higher the mood the smaller the boost. 

Write logic that causes the HP to be calculated by checking how many times the program has run in the past 24 hours. 

Running the program subtracts HP where using boosts adds back HP. The bigger the boost, the more HP restored.
