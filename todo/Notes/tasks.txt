Kingdom:

Animalia
Phylum:

Chordata
Subphylum:

Vertebrata (for vertebrates) or Invertebrata (for invertebrates)
Class:

Examples include Mammalia (mammals), Aves (birds), Reptilia (reptiles), Amphibia (amphibians), Insecta (insects), etc.
Order:

Examples include Carnivora (carnivores), Rodentia (rodents), Primates (primates), Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), Cetacea (whales and dolphins), etc.
Family:

Examples include Felidae (cats), Canidae (dogs), Hominidae (great apes and humans), Bovidae (cows, goats), etc.

Species:

Examples include Panthera leo (lion), Canis lupus (gray wolf), Homo sapiens (human), Equus ferus caballus (horse), etc.Certainly! Here are the highest taxonomic levels in the hierarchical classification of animals:

1. **Kingdom:**
   - Animalia

2. **Phylum:**
   - Chordata

3. **Subphylum:**
   - Vertebrata (for vertebrates) or Invertebrata (for invertebrates)

4. **Class:**
   - Examples include Mammalia (mammals), Aves (birds), Reptilia (reptiles), Amphibia (amphibians), Insecta (insects), etc.

5. **Order:**
   - Examples include Carnivora (carnivores), Rodentia (rodents), Primates (primates), Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), Cetacea (whales and dolphins), etc.

6. **Family:**

8. **Species:**
   - Examples include Panthera leo (lion), Canis lupus (gray wolf), Homo sapiens (human), Equus ferus caballus (horse), etc.

These categories represent a basic outline of the hierarchical classification used in taxonomy to categorize and organize animals based on their evolutionary relationships.
